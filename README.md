1. Try to use a template it really helped me get started with mine: https://html5up.net/
2. I would suggest writting out your project on a piece of paper in order to help brainstorm which ones you want to include on your portfolio 
3. In your about me I really like how you included personal information on your involvement with the swim team: shows personality.
- maybe include which type of computer science you are interested in and why.
4. include a summary for each project!
5. dont forget social media links!
